Once a dog has been selected they are trained to protect their handler and family on command, and within specific threat scenarios. While also being a family pet and guardian it also has to be able to revert to its previous state on command. We not only work with the dog but we also work with the new owners to perfect their dogs&rsquo; obedience,</p>
